#Design and implement a neural network model based on SVM(support vector machine)
##We are working on iris dataset.
##Iris dataset consist of Six things 
  #1.petal widths
  #2.petal lengths
  #3.sepal lengths
  #sepal widths
  #variety of flower
  #Target like 1 represent 1st kind of flower,2nd and so on.
  #finally we will use SVM to train and test the dataset and predict the accuracy in result.
