# Design and implement a neural network model based on SVM,SOM,Perceptron,LVQ.
# We are working on IRIS dataset.
**Iris dataset consist of Six things 
  #1.petal widths
  #2.petal lengths
  #3.sepal lengths
  #sepal widths
  #variety of flower
  #Target like 1 represent 1st kind of flower,2nd and so on.
  ** In this dataset we perform different operation on it by using different models like LVQ,SOM,SVM and perceptron.
